## Feedback

About how long did you and your partners (if any) spend on this project?

> ~14 hours each.

What was the hardest part about this project?

> Figuring out how shadow ray works.
>
> For the extra credit requirements, we had a LOT of trouble figuring out how to render
> area lights (and didn't figure that out :( ).

Is there anything you would change about this project?

> It would be nice if we had a standard for tolerable diff error.
> Worrying about tiny errors that we could probably never fix is a huge pain.
